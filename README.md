# QF620 - Stochastic Modelling in Finance 

This project is a collaborative effort by a team dedicated to exploring the depths of computational finance through the implementation of sophisticated option valuation models. Our team members:

Balina Kirti Kumar

Chia Jun Xian Edmund

Kendrick Winata

Lee Zong Kang

Najwa Jia Hui Rujok

Yao MingYu

successfully derived and implemented four pivotal option valuation models: Black-Scholes, Bachelier, Black76, and Displaced-diffusion in Python. This work highlights our collective proficiency in financial engineering, demonstrating an advanced understanding of both theoretical concepts and their practical applications by accurately valuing vanilla and digital options within real-world financial markets.
